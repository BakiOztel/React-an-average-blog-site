# React-an-average-blog-site
While I was dealing with the project, I took a break due to my exam week and since then I have not been interested in the project. Now when I look again, I see that I wrote a very bad code, so I'm making a cleaner blog site again :) The only difference is that I don't use go for back in my new project. I'll add the link soon. I'm doing a final cleanup for now here.
