# React-an-average-blog-site
 While I was dealing with the project, I took a break because of my exam week, and I haven't been interested in the project since then. Now, when I look again, I see that I wrote a very bad code, so I'm making a cleaner blog site again :) The only difference is that I don't use go for the back side in my new project. I will add the link soon.
